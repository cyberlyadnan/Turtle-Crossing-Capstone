  <h1>Turtle Crossing Capstone Project</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>In this project, you'll control a turtle using the arrow keys to move it across the road. The game gets progressively challenging as more cars appear, requiring quick reflexes and strategic thinking to avoid collisions.</p>

  <h2>Files Overview</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><code>main.py</code>: This file contains the main game logic, including initializing the game, handling user input, updating the game state, and rendering the game on the screen.</li>
    <li><code>car.py</code>: The <code>car.py</code> file defines the Car class, which represents the cars moving across the road. It includes methods for creating cars, moving them, and checking collisions with the turtle.</li>
    <li><code>player_turtle.py</code>: The <code>player_turtle.py</code> file contains the PlayerTurtle class, representing the turtle that the player controls. It handles the turtle's movement, position, and collision detection.</li>
    <li><code>scoreboard.py</code>: The <code>scoreboard.py</code> file manages the player's score and displays it on the screen during gameplay. It tracks the score based on the turtle's successful crossings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org</a>.</li>
    <li>Clone or download the "Turtle-Crossing-Capstone" repository from GitHub:
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cyberlyadnan/Turtle-Crossing-Capstone.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Install the required dependencies using pip:
      <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How to Play</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Run the game by executing the <code>main.py</code> file.</li>
    <li>Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the turtle across the road.</li>
    <li>Guide the turtle to safely cross the road without colliding with any cars.</li>
    <li>As the game progresses, the speed and number of cars increase, making it more challenging.</li>
    <li>The game ends if the turtle collides with a car or reaches the other side successfully.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Controls</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Up Arrow:</strong> Move the turtle upwards.</li>
    <li><strong>Down Arrow:</strong> Move the turtle downwards.</li>
    <li><strong>Left Arrow:</strong> Move the turtle to the left.</li>
    <li><strong>Right Arrow:</strong> Move the turtle to the right.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Responsive turtle movement controlled by arrow keys.</li>
    <li>Dynamic generation and movement of cars on the road.</li>
    <li>Score tracking to monitor the number of successful crossings.</li>
  </ul>
